# Maze Sparkle

"Maze Sparkle" immerses players in an intriguing maze adventure where a propelled ball, guided by the player, navigates obstacles and puzzles on its way to the labyrinth's exit. Unleash your strategic prowess as you anticipate rebound trajectories and
harness the shadows cast by the main ball.
